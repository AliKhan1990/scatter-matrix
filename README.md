# scatter-matrix.js

scatter-matrix.js (SM) is a JavaScript library for drawing scatterplot matrix.
SM handles matrix data in CSV format: rows represent samples and columns
represent observations. SM interprets the first row as a header. All numeric
columns appear as rows and columns of the scatterplot matrix. Additionally, SM
allows user to select a non-numeric column to color dots on the scatter plots.

SM is a simple extension/generalization of [Mike Bostock's scatterplot matrix
example](http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/iris-splom.html).

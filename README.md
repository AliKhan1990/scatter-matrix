scatter-matrix.js (SM) is a JavaScript library for drawing scatter matrix plots
for matrix data. SM handles matrix in CSV format: rows represent samples and
columns represent observations. SM interprets the first row as a header. All
numeric columns appear as rows and columns of the scatter plot. Additionally,
SM allows user to select a non-numeric column to color dots on the scatter
plot.
